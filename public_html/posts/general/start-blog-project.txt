My smol blogging platform made in C
I was not satisfied with any of the blogging platfom so I made my own with black jack and h00kers.
It is once C file that compiles to 10KB Linux binary.

You interact with it with files. Project has this structure:
* /working_dir/
* /generate/
* /public_html/
* /templates/

/working_dir/ is where all the text files are organized in folders. Each folder is a tag.
/generete/ is where the engine looks for a new files to cranch. It will move it to the /public_html/ folder and update the index file.
/templates/ keeps template files for the layout of the blog.

It is simple, lean and easy to use.

How to compile:
* gcc smolblog.c -o smolblog
* upx smolblog

Usage:
* ./smolblog
* copy text files into the /generate/ folder.
